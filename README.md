Registration Form
This is a basic registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that performs real-time validation. The form checks for required fields, validates the email format, and ensures the password is at least 6 characters long. The form only enables the submit button when all validation checks are passed.

Features

Dynamic Error Messages: When a validation rule is violated, an error message appears below the corresponding field.

Submit Button: The submit button remains disabled until the form is valid.
